# hydropowerClimateChange
This repository hosts the code and data for an analysis using the WWF Water Risk Filter to demonstrate how one such tool can be used to screen for a variety of risks at a global scale, including risks to riverine ecosystems from both climate change and hydropower as well as risks to hydropower projects — and operators, owners, and investors — from climate change and potential regulatory or reputational risk arising from negative impacts to ecosystems.
