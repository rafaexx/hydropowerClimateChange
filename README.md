# HydropowerClimateChange
This repository hosts the code and data for an analysis using the [WWF Water Risk Filter][wrf_homepage] to demonstrate how one such tool can be used to screen for a variety of risks at a global scale, including risks to riverine ecosystems from both climate change and hydropower as well as risks to hydropower projects — and operators, owners, and investors — from climate change and potential regulatory or reputational risk arising from negative impacts to ecosystems. The study is under review in the special issue of the MDPI journal Water: [Hydro-Meteorological Hazards under Climate Change][journal].

The complete dataset — that is, the GRanD v1.3 and FHReD datasets from [globaldamwatch.org][gdw], added with the Water Risk Filter risk scores and risk changes — is available at https://zenodo.org/record/5826187 .

A ShinyApp is available at https://rcamargo.shinyapps.io/HydropowerClimateChange/
